# Drawing and Animating the Apple Logo
A fun project playing around with TimelineView and Canvas in SwiftUI 3.0.

## Usage
1. Build and run ðŸ˜„

## How it Works
The Apple logo is drawn in the `appleLogo` function with the help of the Path structure from SwiftUI. 

This function is then called inside the new `Canvas` view that is used to draw the graphic. This view is then wrapped around a `TimelineView` to animate the color changing of the logo.

## Future
**I won't be working on this but if you're interested, you can play around with the current color animation to make it change colors much more smoothly. I'll merge your PR if it works.**
